# Installation of bedder 
## Binary options
- bedder-static-linux-x86_64: Static binary for Linux x86_64 
- bedder-static-macos-x86_64: Mostly static binary for macOS x86_64 

## Linux Installation
As of June 2025, the linux binary, when installed on a cluster, requires the use of a python virtual environment (venv). 
```
# Download Linux binary and make it executable
wget https://github.com/quinlan-lab/bedder-rs/releases/download/v0.1.2/bedder-static-linux-x86_64
chmod +x bedder-static-linux-x86_64

# Check whether install was successful
./bedder-static-linux-x86_64

```
If installation is successful, running the command "bedder" should produce an error regarding lack of input arguments:
```
[<DATE> INFO  bedder] starting up
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  -a <QUERY_PATH>
  -b <OTHER_PATHS>
  --genome <GENOME_FILE>
```
### Linux troubleshoot

If installation is unsuccessful, consider:

#### Reinstalling in a python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
wget https://github.com/quinlan-lab/bedder-rs/releases/download/v0.1.2/bedder-static-linux-x86_64
chmod +x bedder-static-linux-x86_64
```

#### Calling the command from the current directory
```
./bedder-static-linux-x86_64
```

#### Relocating the binary to $PATH
This may be necessary if above check fails or if you are hoping to install the linux binary in a particular location distinct from the default. 

```

# To determine what $PATH are available: 
echo "$PATH"
# Move to $PATH
sudo mv bedder-static-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/bedder

```

## macOS Installation 
```
# Download Mac binary and make executable
wget https://github.com/quinlan-lab/bedder-rs/releases/download/v0.1.2/bedder-static-macos-x86_64
chmod +x bedder-static-macos-x86_64

# Check whether install was successful
./bedder-static-macos-x86_64

```
Once again, if installation is successful, running the command "bedder" should produce the following error regarding lack of input arguments:
```
[<DATE> INFO  bedder] starting up
error: the following required arguments were not provided:
  -a <QUERY_PATH>
  -b <OTHER_PATHS>
  --genome <GENOME_FILE>
```
### macOS troubleshoot
If installation is unsuccessful, consider:

#### Reinstalling in a python virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
wget https://github.com/quinlan-lab/bedder-rs/releases/download/v0.1.2/bedder-static-macos-x86_64
chmod +x bedder-static-macos-x86_64
```

#### Calling the command from the current directory
```
./bedder-static-macos-x86_64
```

#### Relocating the binary to $PATH
This may be necessary if above check fails or if you are hoping to install the macOS binary in a particular location distinct from the default. 
```
# To determine what $PATH are available: 
echo "$PATH"
# Move to $PATH
sudo mv bedder-static-macos-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/bedder

```
